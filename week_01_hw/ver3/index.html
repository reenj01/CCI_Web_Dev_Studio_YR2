          experiment in a closed box which contains a live cat and a phial of poison
        </li>
        <li>
          if radioactive decay occurs, the poison container breaks open and the cat dies
        </li>
        <li>
          there is a 50-50 chance that the cat will be killed
        </li>
        <li>
          but without looking inside the box, we cannot say whether the cat is dead or alive
