### What I Changed

Note: The original html file is extremely long, so I decided not to add comments, as it will take ages to find each comment. Instead, I will write out each of the revisions along with the line #.

1. Line 3188 & 3458: I got rid of the awkward width length and removed the extra white space left and right of the main page.
2. Line 1815, 2487, 3834, 3774, 3866 & 4478: Change the grid span length of the center images and the left text to increase the text container width and reduce the image width, to make the text more visible & readable.
3. Line 2711: made the other international website text lighter, making it more evident which site the user is on.
4. Line : Removed the right column completely as that can be found under the dropdown menus, and can be overwhelming for users to have two columns full of text and images.
5. Line 1539 & 1554: Increased the font-size of the article titles.
6. Line 1202: Increased the font-size for the drop-down menus for the different article categories.
